Day 7 Homework
=================

Data Modeling:

* Create a set of classes using inheritance
* It should show that Pandas and Sharks both eat Fish
* When a Panda or a shark eats, it should log this out to a Log

Example:

```ruby
panda = Panda.new
panda.eat

Log.log
=> ["panda ate"]
```

Data Modeling 2:
* Do the same excercise, but with Modules instead of inheritance
